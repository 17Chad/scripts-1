# scripts
<h1>Collection of scripts for the lazy ... >.></h1>


The scripts/codes included above all can be used with the Internet Explorer Developer Tools. To use the developer tools follow these steps:</br></br>
<ol>
  <li>Open your class in Internet Explorer.</li>
  <li>Press the F12 key when your class is fully loaded. This will open the developer tools.</li>
  <li>Click on the Console tab of the developer tools window.</li>
  <li>Paste the code in the text box at the bottom of the console tab.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>If the code is one line then you can simply press the ENTER key.</li>
    <li>If the code is more than one line then you have to either manually click on the green Play arrow or hold CTRL and press ENTER.</li>   </ol>
  <li>At this point the results will vary for the code being used and follow up directions will be included as needed.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>*Notice*</h2>
Scripts here are for the most part updated when I need them and not by request.
SSDs can't be updated by me due to no longer having access to those classes.
JKO script still works ... just don't use it on the tests.

Enjoy :D
